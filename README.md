Hi, I'm Ioannis 👋

Research Software Engineer @ University of Glasgow Electrocardiology Lab — teaching machines to read hearts, an attempt to reason.

Currently building AF detection models. Completing a PhD in Network Neuroscience at King's College London.

By day: ECG pipelines, 1D CNNs, and database schemas that haunt my dreams.
By night: Experimental electroacoustic composer (Levant Noir), playing lavta, modular synths
